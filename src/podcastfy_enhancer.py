        CRITICAL: Make this sound EXACTLY like NotebookLM:
        
        1. NATURAL REACTIONS:
        - "Oh wow, {market_data['wti_crude']}? That's actually..."
        - "[laughs] Okay, so let me get this straight..."
        - "Wait wait wait, hold onâ€”"
        - "That's... that's actually fascinating"
        
        2. INTERRUPTIONS & OVERLAPS:
        - Sam cuts off Alex mid-sentence with questions
        - Alex trails off when making connections "So if we look at... oh, OH!"
        - Both occasionally talk at once briefly
        
        3. INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC BANTER:
        - Joke about "another day, another OPEC announcement"
        - Reference famous oil discoveries casually
        - Use drilling terminology naturally
        - Make comparisons to "that time in 2014 when oil crashed"
        
        4. TECHNICAL BUT ACCESSIBLE:
        - Explain horizontal drilling like "imagine drinking a milkshake..."
        - Compare fracking to "basically creating tiny earthquakes"
        - Use barrel counts but translate to "that's like X cars for a year"
        
        5. GENUINE CHEMISTRY:
        - Callback to earlier points
        - Friendly disagreement on predictions
        - Shared excitement over big discoveries
        - Natural tangents that loop back
